# loop_blocking
Experiments in achieving C performance in Rust when manipulating arrays.

Specifially the idea here is to write, in Rust, the equavalent of the C code shown in this article by Intel
about cache friendly processing of arrays: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/loop-optimizations-where-blocks-are-required

## Build Rust

   $ cargo build --release

or build and run with:

   $ cargo run --release

## Build C

By way of a performance comparison the C version is included

    gcc -Wall -O3 -o loop_blocking_32 loop_blocking_32.c

And using 64 bit array elements:

    gcc -Wall -O3 -o loop_blocking_64 loop_blocking_64.c
